Value type vs Reference type

1. Value type wil directly hold the value while reference type will hold the memory address or reference of the value. 
2. Value type will be stored in the stack memory while reference type will be stored in the heap memory. 
3. Value type will not be collected by the garbage collector but the reference type will be collected by garbage collector. 
4. The value type can be created by struct or enum but reference type can be created by class, interface, delegates or array. 
5. Value type can not accept any null value while reference type can accept null values. 

Boxing: an operation that converts a value type to the reference type(object type)
Unboxing: an operation that converts a reference type(object type) to the value type

Managed Resources: Automatically managed by the CLR, subject to garbage collection.
Unmanaged Resources: Manually managed by the developer, requiring explicit release to avoid memory leaks.

In essence, the Garbage Collector in .NET automates memory management, enhances application stability,
and improves performance by efficiently reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer needed.
