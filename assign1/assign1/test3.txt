1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
Use String when:
You have a small number of string manipulations.
You prefer immutability, as String objects are immutable.
Performance is not a critical concern.
Use StringBuilder when:
You are performing numerous string manipulations 
You need better performance for large strings or frequent modifications, as StringBuilder is mutable and designed for such scenarios.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
You can sort an array in C# using the Array.Sort() method.

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
The property used to get the total number of elements in an array is Length. For example:

int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
int totalElements = numbers.Length; // totalElements will be 3

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No, System.Array is a strongly typed collection, meaning all elements must be of the same type. 
However, you can create an array of type object, which can hold different data types, but this requires boxing and unboxing.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
Array.CopyTo():
Copies the entire array to a specified array starting at a particular index.
The original array and the destination array remain separate; changes to one do not affect the other.

Array.Clone():
Creates a shallow copy of the array.
The original array and the cloned array are separate, but if the array contains reference types, both arrays will reference the same objects.
