1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
Dividing an int variable by 0 results in a DivideByZeroException at runtime. This is because division by zero is mathematically undefined.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
When you divide a double variable by 0, the result is Infinity (positive or negative, depending on the sign of the numerator). If the numerator is 0, the result is NaN (Not a Number).

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
When you overflow an int variable, it wraps around to the minimum value of the integer type. For example, if you exceed Int32.MaxValue, it will roll over to Int32.MinValue. In C#, this behavior can be checked with the checked keyword to throw an exception on overflow.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
x = y++; assigns the current value of y to x, then increments y by 1 (post-increment).
x = ++y; increments y by 1 first, then assigns the new value of y to x (pre-increment).
5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
break: Exits the loop entirely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
return: Exits the entire method, returning control to the caller.
6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
The three parts of a for statement are:

Initialization (e.g., int i = 0;)
Condition (e.g., i < 10;)
Iteration (e.g., i++)
Only the condition part is required; the other two can be omitted, but the semicolons must remain.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
= is the assignment operator used to assign a value to a variable.
== is the equality operator used to compare two values for equality.
8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
Yes, this statement compiles. It creates an infinite loop since there is no exit condition, but it is syntactically correct.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
In a switch expression, the underscore _ acts as a discard pattern, matching any value that hasn't been matched by previous cases. It is typically used as a default case.

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
An object must implement the IEnumerable interface (or IEnumerable<T> for generic collections) to be enumerated using the foreach statement.
